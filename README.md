# parking_sys
A Php Final Project.Please don't mess, we are students and we don't have money to make it private. We are poor as shit and we are just trying to graduate, so have mercy and don't mess with our code.

This project is a college project where we are developing a simple system that enables a user to order a parking space in advance. We make use of SQL and PHP , blah blah blah. 

tl;dr ==> it's not that long, just read it.
